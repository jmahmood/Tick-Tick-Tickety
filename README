TICK-TICK-TICKETY

Tick-tick-tickety is a server-based application that implements a REST protocol to store & retrieve information from Geiger Counters.

The primary purpose of this is to make it easier for those of us in Tokyo to syndicate & share geiger counter information.  This will be achieved through GET and POST commands.  The protocol itself is currently undergoing development.

A second (eventual) purpose is to make it easier to understand WHERE the information is coming from, hopefully allowing us to build a web of trust (rather than blind trust in figures posted on the Internet)

This program is licenced under the GPL3.  It's free - and it is my dearest hope that it stays free.  

This program could not have been done without the kind assistance of the Tokyo Hackerspace. 

_CURRENT STATE OF PROTOCOL_

I'm modifying it as I go along, but the basic idea, as of now, is:

URL://get/Tokyo/
# Return the raw geiger counter readings for tokyo for the week

URL://get/Tokyo/average/
# Return the average geiger counter readings for tokyo for the week

URL://get/Tokyo/median/
# Return the median geiger counter readings for tokyo for the week

URL://get/Tokyo/from/YYYY-MM-DD/
# Return the raw  geiger counter readings for tokyo from YYYY-MM-DD

URL://get/Tokyo/to/YYYY-MM-DD/
# Return the raw  geiger counter readings for tokyo until YYYY-MM-DD

URL://get/Tokyo/alpha/
# Return the raw  alpha particle geiger counter readings for Tokyo

URL://get/Tokyo/beta/
# Return the raw  beta particle geiger counter readings for Tokyo

URL://get/Tokyo/gamma/
# Return the raw  beta particle geiger counter readings for Tokyo

All of these commands can be mixed together (where it makes sense).  For instance:

URL://get/Tokyo/alpha/from/YYYY-MM-DD/average/
# Will return an average all of the alpha particle geiger counter data from YYYY-MM-DD until the present

Similarly, we are implementing a POST protocol for sharing information.  Geiger counter information can be then shared by any device that is capable of making basic HTTP GET and POST requests. 

If you think it is all wrong, please feel free to point out my foibles.  Arigato.
